> **About this project**: A complete adaptation suite to get DeepSeek Harness (dsh) fully running on HarmonyOS devices. Almost nobody has done this on HarmonyOS—native ELF/.node modules, node-pty, and Koffi cannot load on such devices. This repository distills the whole engineering effort—installation, patching, cache optimization, plugin installation, and self-update—into a reproducible open-source solution:
>
> - **Eight HarmonyOS "conversation mode" Agent presets**: push DeepSeek's prefix cache hit rate to the maximum while retaining task delivery capability—`harmony-chat` (minimal) / `harmony-chat-pro` (cache-optimized) / `harmony-chat-promax` (strongest Hexagon delivery) / `harmony-chat-ops` (resident background task steward) / `harmony-chat-rampagemax` (Rampage Max quality) / `harmony-kb` (knowledge-base expert) / `harmony-deveco` (DevEco full-stack development master) / `harmony-chat-monash` (Monash student edition)
> - **Hexagon ProMax** (upgraded 2026-08-18): six hard rules in one place—cache hit, token savings, delivery capability, test verification, integration loop, coexistence defense—turning the gap between "code written" and "system running" into a mechanical checklist, with delivery discipline benchmarked against and exceeding mainstream general-purpose Agents
> - **Rampage Max** (added 2026-08-18): an extreme mode that spends token without restraint, prioritizing quality and delivery—runtime context and web fetching fully enabled, exhaustive pre-check scanning, integration loop and double verification written as iron rules. Use with caution: high token consumption, may drain your account quota
> - **Launch patches** `harmony.patch.yml` (web) + `harmony-headless.patch.yml` (headless): disable plugin lines that depend on native binaries, so dsh no longer crashes on startup
> - **node_modules patch scripts**: work around the HarmonyOS filesystem restrictions (`chmod 600` rejected, no hard-link support) + restore the dialog permission presets (`dsh-permission-presets` reads `sandboxMode` from the fs sandbox; the read-only/workspace-write/danger-full-access dropdown is back)
> - **Measured token savings**: an A/B benchmark over 11 tasks verifies `reasoningEffort: high` as Pareto-optimal (all correct + fewest steps + nearly unchanged cost), with the promax delegation group routing complex subtasks to a Pro model as fallback
> - **Five-preset benchmark (2026-08-18)**: after static persona padding (prefix crosses the 128-token chunk boundary), the static-prefix presets' cache hit rate rose from 52.9%–89.9% to **93.8%–98.0%** (promax 96.7%, ops 97.9%, rampagemax 98.0%), and even harmony-chat with runtime context enabled was pulled up to 93.8%—data confirming that "to preserve the cache, keep the prefix stable first" (see "Performance Benchmarks" below)
> - **Toolchain**: one-click GitHub plugin installer, dsh self-updater + settings page
> - **Global prompt-antivirus `dsh-prompt-antivirus`** (added 2026-08-31): scans tool arguments / tool results / messages before they enter the model, quarantining or blocking prompt injection and "context-virus" payloads; injects a per-session canary guard and routes high-risk dangerous tools through human approval—mounted at the profile layer, active globally across all presets and subagents

- **Eight HarmonyOS "conversation mode" Agent presets**: push DeepSeek's prefix cache hit rate to the maximum while retaining task delivery capability—`harmony-chat` (minimal) / `harmony-chat-pro` (cache-optimized) / `harmony-chat-promax` (strongest Hexagon delivery) / `harmony-chat-ops` (resident background task steward) / `harmony-chat-rampagemax` (Rampage Max quality) / `harmony-kb` (knowledge-base expert) / `harmony-deveco` (DevEco full-stack development master) / `harmony-chat-monash` (Monash student edition)
- **Hexagon ProMax** (upgraded 2026-08-18): six hard rules in one place—cache hit, token savings, delivery capability, test verification, integration loop, coexistence defense—turning the gap between "code written" and "system running" into a mechanical checklist, with delivery discipline benchmarked against and exceeding mainstream general-purpose Agents

Use with caution: high token consumption, may drain your account quota
- **HarmonyOS Dev Master `harmony-deveco`** (added 2026-08-20): a DevEco full-stack development agent—drives hvigor/ohpm/hdc through the dev_* tools to close the "write ArkTS → build → deploy to device → launch" loop (including signing/packaging guidance); `dev_code` delegates deep sub-tasks to the local DevEco Code agent (OpenCode web, 127.0.0.1:4096). Kirin X90 software-hardware-coordinated power discipline: serialized delegation, never saturating the 4 cores
- **Launch patches** `harmony.patch.yml` (web) + `harmony-headless.patch.yml` (headless): disable plugin lines that depend on native binaries, so dsh no longer crashes on startup
- **node_modules patch scripts**: work around the HarmonyOS filesystem restrictions (`chmod 600` rejected, no hard-link support) + restore the dialog permission presets (`dsh-permission-presets` reads `sandboxMode` from the fs sandbox; the read-only/workspace-write/danger-full-access dropdown is back)
- **Measured token savings**: an A/B benchmark over 11 tasks verifies `reasoningEffort: high` as Pareto-optimal (all correct + fewest steps + nearly unchanged cost), with the promax delegation group routing complex subtasks to a Pro model as fallback

- **Global prompt-antivirus `dsh-prompt-antivirus`** (added 2026-08-31): scans tool arguments / tool results / messages before they enter the model, quarantining or blocking prompt injection and "context-virus" payloads smuggled inside `[CRON TASK]` / `[SCHEDULE REMINDER]` / web-search results / file contents; injects a per-session canary guard and routes high-risk dangerous tools through human approval; `block` / `quarantine` / `monitor` modes plus local audit logging—mounted at the profile layer, active globally across all presets and subagents, pure JS with zero dependencies

## Why This Suite Is Needed

| HarmonyOS device limitation | Consequence | Solution in this repo |
|---|---|---|
| Cannot load native ELF / `.node` modules | `node-pty` (subprocess), `Koffi` (sandbox/fs-local) crash on startup | `harmony.patch.yml` disables these plugin lines |
| Filesystem enforces group permission bits, `chmod 600` is rejected | Credential file permission check always fails; cannot configure an API key | Patch `dsh-credentials-local`: `assertOwnerOnly` returns immediately |
| Filesystem does not support hard links | Session persistence `link()` emits `EPERM` in release logs | Patch `dsh-session-persistence-jsonl`: `link` changed to `rename` |
| No bash shell on HarmonyOS (native sandbox deps disabled) | No permission-preset dropdown in the dialog (read-only/workspace-write/danger-full-access) | Patch `dsh-permission-presets`: read `sandboxMode` from the fs sandbox (pure JS, always running) |
| HarmonyOS storage rejects hard links / some mount points refuse read-only handles | Image reading (read_image / attachment) `link()` emits `EPERM`, directory `fsync` errors; images cannot persist → the model never sees them | Patch `dsh-attachment-local`: on `link` failure publish via `copy` (EEXIST race goes through sha256 integrity check); `syncDirectory` skips fsync on EPERM/EACCES/ENOTSUP mount points |
| HarmonyOS storage rejects hard links | New-file writes in the workspace (`createIfAbsent`) `link()` emits `EPERM`, so new files cannot be created | Patch `dsh-fs-local`: verify the target is absent, then publish via `rename`, preserving create-if-absent semantics |
| `dsh-visual-plugin` (third-party) panel defaults to an unconfigured vision endpoint | `vision model is not configured`, or a custom prompt returns empty text and gets hard-thrown | Patch `dsh-visual-plugin`: when the endpoint is empty, fall back to the main DeepSeek vision model (`llm-deepseek` + `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`); retry once on empty content and degrade to a clear message |
| `git ls-remote` is intercepted by the isogit shim | GitHub-source plugins cannot be installed | `scripts/dsh-hm-install.mjs` installer (fetch source → build → symlink) |

## Security Statement

Everything in this repository is plain-text / pure-JS configuration and scripts. It does **not delete, encrypt, or transmit your data, does not register system services, and does not require root**. Safe to use:

- **Pure JS / plain text**: presets are YAML config files, patches are YAML overlay layers, plugins are zero-dependency pure JS (only `node:fs/promises`), scripts are Node/Shell text. No executable binaries, native `.node`/ELF modules, kernel modifications, or drivers.
- **No system-level changes**: does not register `systemd` / autostart / system scheduled tasks, does not modify system paths, does not require root. All writes occur within the dsh installation directory and the `~/.dsh` user config directory.
- **Your data is untouched**: presets only modify dsh's "conversation mode" config; plugins only enumerate directories and read files; patches only enable/disable dsh's own plugin lines. Your files are never deleted, overwritten, encrypted, or transmitted.
- **Minimal network behavior**: only loads config when dsh starts and only accesses the official DeepSeek and GitHub APIs when you actively start a conversation or check for updates. No telemetry, no tracking, no data reporting.
- **Fully auditable**: the entire repository contains just over 20 text files; every single line can be opened and inspected.
- **Reversible uninstall**: delete `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/harmony-chat-ops/`, `~/dsh-test/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-list/` and `@deepseek-ai/dsh-deveco-bridge/`, and the corresponding profile-layer symlinks, then restart dsh to fully restore.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Install dsh

```bash
cd ~/dsh-test && npm install @deepseek-ai/dsh
```

> The install location can be overridden with the `DSH_DIR` environment variable; the default `~/dsh-test` is used below.

### 2. Deploy the presets (conversation modes)

Copy the preset directories into dsh's user preset directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.dsh/.agent-presets
cp -r presets/* ~/.dsh/.agent-presets/
```

Then set the default conversation mode to one of them in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
agent-presets:
  default: harmony-chat-promax
```

All eight modes can be freely switched at any time in the "conversation mode" dropdown of dsh's settings panel (switching only affects new sessions). See [docs/CACHE-OPTIMIZATION.en.md](docs/CACHE-OPTIMIZATION.en.md) for why they are fast.

| Mode | persona | Cache strategy | Tool set |
|---|---|---|---|
| `harmony-chat` (base) | Normal | Runtime context enabled (prefix varies) | Single Agent |
| `harmony-chat-pro` (cache-optimized) | `complete:true` unique prompt section | Zero prefix change, maximum hit rate | Single Agent, planning discipline built in |
| `harmony-chat-promax` (strongest Hexagon delivery) | `complete:false` | Runtime context disabled, long stable prefix | + Subagents / workflows / Ralph delegation group + six hard delivery rules |
| `harmony-chat-ops` (task steward) | Resident background task steward | Runtime context disabled, stable prefix | + Scheduled tasks (cron_create/list/set_enabled/delete + schedule_create/list/delete) + directory enumeration (list_dir) |
| `harmony-chat-rampagemax` (Rampage Max) | No token savings, quality and delivery first | Runtime context enabled (prefix varies) + web fetching fully enabled | + Delegation group (all Pro) + exhaustive pre-check / double verification / retrospective iron rules |
| `harmony-chat-rampagemax` (Rampage Max, use with caution) | No token savings, quality and delivery first | **Runtime context enabled**, dynamic prefix, low hit rate | All promax capabilities + web fetch fully enabled + double verification/cross-checking + full-Pro delegation + exhaustive pre-check scan |
| `harmony-kb` (knowledge-base expert) | Workspace-as-knowledge-base: layered retrieval / deep research / doc organization / mind maps / notes | Runtime context disabled, stable prefix | + directory enumeration (list_dir) + Obsidian wikilink note push |
| `harmony-deveco` (Dev Master) | HarmonyOS DevEco full-stack development (write ArkTS → build → deploy → launch) | Runtime context disabled, stable prefix | + dev_environment/build/install_deps/list_devices/deploy + dev_code (delegate to local DevEco Code agent) + Kirin X90 power discipline |
| `harmony-chat-monash` (Monash student edition) | Monash all-campus study assistant: literature interpretation / plagiarism check / assignment help + student services & Melbourne transport KB | Runtime context disabled, long stable prefix (same as ProMax) | Same full tool set as promax (fs / web search / delegation / workflows) |

### 2.4 Hexagon ProMax: the ceiling of delivery capability on HarmonyOS

`harmony-chat-promax` does not trade off between "cache hit" and "delivery capability"; instead it applies six hard rules in one place—each one distilled from a real pitfall encountered in practice:

| # | Dimension | Rule | Failure mode it guards against |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Cache hit** | `includeRuntimeContext:false`; system prompt fully static, zero prefix change | Prefix varies dynamically with the session, DeepSeek's cache hit rate bottoms out (uncached input is roughly **30×** more expensive) |
| 2 | **Token savings** | Static prefix + task tiering: light tasks completed directly without a plan; only heavy tasks run the full loop | Turning even simple Q&A into plans/multiple round trips, wasting output |
| 3 | **Delivery capability** | Keep all prompt sections (planning strategy / tool guidance / delegation group), only disable runtime context | Trimming into a thin shell to preserve the cache, heavy tasks cannot be delivered |
| 4 | **Test verification** | "Before claiming done, you must run verification commands and obtain real output; no evidence equals not done" | Claiming done right after writing code, with syntax/regression fully unguarded |
| 5 | **Integration loop** | Delivery = files written + dependencies in place (node_modules symlinks) + service restarted + boot loading verified + functionality actually tested | "File correct" ≠ "system runs"; the missing steps are left undone |
| 6 | **Coexistence defense** | Scan for conflicts before starting (namespace / wiring.id / system-prompt slots / settings-page order / tool names), reuse an isomorphic already-shipped reference as a template | New plugins step on each other; shared-resource changes don't list the impact scope |

All six rules live in the static persona text of `agent.cordis.yml`, injecting no dynamic content—**the rules themselves do not break rule #1's cache hit**.

#### Comparison with other Agents

| Capability | Hexagon ProMax | Mainstream general-purpose Agent (Claude Code / Codex CLI / Cursor, etc.) |
|---|---|---|
| Cache hit rate | Static prefix preserves the cache, maximum hit rate | Runtime context varies with the session, fragile prefix, high uncached cost |
| Token cost | Cached input ≈ 1/30 the price; zero waste on light tasks | Dynamic injection per request, cache benefit greatly diminished |
| Platform awareness | Knows the HarmonyOS/dsh-specific constraints: no native ELF, `chmod 600` rejected, no hard-link support, isogit shim, native plugins crash on startup | Modeled on Linux/server assumptions; crashes or is restricted from the first step on HarmonyOS |
| Integration loop | **symlink → restart → boot verification → live test** hard-coded as a mechanical checklist | Stops at code written + tests passed; doesn't know the dsh-specific steps |
| Verification discipline | "Evidence after a change" written into the persona; verification commands and output recorded | Relies on model discretion, not enforced; prone to "should be fine" empty assertions |

**Why it crushes general-purpose Agents:** A general-purpose Agent's "done" standard is "code written + tests passed", but the "done" standard for dsh plugin delivery is "the system actually runs". The difference is exactly that whole stretch of **platform-specific finishing steps**—node_modules symlinks must be created inside the `~/.dsh` tree, restarts must use `--patch harmony.patch.yml`, boot entries must be verified as loaded, and functionality must be tested live. General-purpose Agents don't know these steps; they treat "written" as the finish line. ProMax writes this mechanical checklist into the persona, making the "finishing" an unskippable part of delivery.

**Where these rules came from:** They were not designed; they grew out of real plugin-development testing. Problems exposed while using ProMax to write the Arknights operator character plugin (dsh-arknights-persona)—zero syntax errors, all APIs correct (9/10), but the node_modules symlink wasn't created, no restart, no boot verification, no live test (integration loop only 6/10)—each became a rule in the table above. That's exactly what "strongest delivery" means: **code delivery 9/10, system running 6/10—the gap is in finishing discipline, not intelligence.**

### 2.5 Install the ops-mode dependency (only required by `harmony-chat-ops`)

The ops preset references a **custom plugin** outside dsh, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-list` (directory enumeration; the dsh fs service has no readdir). It is not part of dsh's base installation and must be placed in two locations manually (source + profile-layer symlink, both required):

```bash
# ① Put the source into dsh's base node_modules (presets resolve by bare package name to this layer)
cp -r plugins/@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-list ~/dsh-test/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/
# ② Symlink into the profile-layer dependency tree (web profile's node_modules resolves up to profiles/node_modules)
ln -s ~/dsh-test/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-list ~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/
```

> The scheduled-task tools `schedule_create/list/delete` ship with dsh's base installation (`@deepseek-ai/dsh-schedule` is a direct dsh dependency), and `harmony.patch.yml` already mounts them via `insert`; no additional installation needed.

### 2.6 Install the harmony-deveco dependency (`dsh-deveco-bridge`)

The `harmony-deveco` dev_* tools are provided by another **custom plugin** outside dsh, `@deepseek-ai/dsh-deveco-bridge` (drives hvigor/ohpm/hdc + `dev_code` delegation; pure JS via node:child_process, no native deps). It is not part of dsh's base installation and must be placed in two locations manually (source + profile-layer symlink, both required — same as `dsh-tool-list` in 2.5):

```bash
# ① Put the source into dsh's base node_modules (presets resolve by bare package name to this layer)
cp -r plugins/@deepseek-ai/dsh-deveco-bridge ~/dsh-test/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/
# ② Symlink into the profile-layer dependency tree
ln -s ~/dsh-test/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh-deveco-bridge ~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/
```

The preset ships with the `- id: deveco-bridge` mount row, so dev_* tools are available automatically in the `harmony-deveco` preset. To expose dev_* in other presets too, add an `insert` block to your profile patch `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: deveco-bridge
      name: '@deepseek-ai/dsh-deveco-bridge'
```

> **Tool paths**: the plugin looks in `$HOME/deveco/deveco_tools/` for node/hvigor/sdk/ohpm (DevEco Studio's default install location); point `DEVECO_TOOLS_HOME` at a custom root, or override individually with `DEVECO_NODE_HOME` / `DEVECO_HVIGOR_HOME` / `DEVECO_SDK_HOME` / `DEVECO_OHPM_BIN` / `DEVECO_HDC_BIN`.
>
> **`dev_code` delegation**: hands a self-contained deep sub-task to the local DevEco Code agent (OpenCode web, 127.0.0.1:4096) which runs its own agent loop. Start DevEco Code and configure DeepSeek first (`~/.deveco/deveco.jsonc`); override the address with `DEVECO_WEB_BASE`. Each delegation costs ~13K input tokens and runs serially — reserve it for deep sub-tasks (power discipline is baked into the preset persona).

### 3. Start dsh (with the HarmonyOS patches)

```bash
sh scripts/dsh-web.sh
# Equivalent manual startup:
# cd ~/dsh-test && node --expose-internals node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js \
#   --profile web --patch <this repo>/harmony.patch.yml
```

After startup, open `http://127.0.0.1:3080` in a browser.

> **`--expose-internals` is required**, otherwise `cordis-plugin-hmr` errors out; `--patch harmony.patch.yml` is required, otherwise native plugins crash. `dsh-web.sh` automatically locates the patch file in the repository by default, or it can be overridden with `PATCH_YML`.

### 3.5 Headless mode (unattended / benchmarking)

The headless tree has more native-dependency plugin lines than web (bash/pwsh/fs-search, etc.), so a second patch is needed:

```bash
cd ~/dsh-test && node --expose-internals node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js \
  --profile headless --patch <this repo>/harmony-headless.patch.yml "task description"
```

> ⚠ `fs-sandbox` is the pure-JS provider of the fs service and **must not be disabled** (`tool-fs` depends on it). The headless patch only disables native-dependency plugin lines.

### 3.6 Startup after reboot

HarmonyOS has no `systemd` / `cron` / `XDG autostart`. After a shutdown-then-power-on, bring dsh back up with any of the following:

**① Repository script (recommended; idempotent probe on 3080)**

```bash
sh scripts/dsh-web.sh        # skips if already running; otherwise starts and waits for the health check
```

Equivalent manual startup (no script):

```bash
cd ~/dsh-test && node --expose-internals node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js \
  --profile web --patch <this repo>/harmony.patch.yml
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:3080` in a browser.

**② Headless (unattended / benchmarking)**

```bash
cd ~/dsh-test && node --expose-internals node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/lib/bin.js \
  --profile headless --patch <this repo>/harmony-headless.patch.yml "task description"
```

**③ Boot auto-restore (optional)**: enable the "Terminal" app to auto-start at boot in HarmonyOS Settings, then add a probe hook to your shell config (e.g. `~/.zshrc`) that pulls services up every time a terminal opens:

```bash
for _svc in dsh-web; do sh "$HOME/bin/$_svc.sh" >/dev/null 2>&1 & done
```

`dsh-web.sh` is idempotent: it skips if already running and starts only when down, so no manual intervention is needed after a reboot. See the "Limitations" section below for the rationale.

### 4. Apply the node_modules patches (re-apply after upgrade/reinstall)

```bash
node scripts/dsh-update.mjs patch
```

Re-applies the nine patches idempotently using content anchors (recognizes code changes in new versions). Without these nine patches:
- Can't configure a model API key (credential 660 permission check)
- Sending messages errors with `EPERM link` (session persistence)
- No permission-preset dropdown in the dialog (`dsh-permission-presets` must read `sandboxMode` from the fs sandbox)
- Image reading can't persist (attachment-local: `link`→`copy` publish + mount-point fsync tolerance)
- New-file workspace writes fail with `EPERM link` (dsh-fs-local: on `createIfAbsent`, `link` failure falls back to `rename`)
- Vision reports "model not configured" / custom prompt returns empty text (dsh-visual-plugin falls back to the main vision model + empty-content retry/degrade)
- Bare plugin names resolve from `dsh-test` and fail (`cordis-plugin-loader` needs a `v0` legacy internal-loader shape for HarmonyOS node v22.7.0, which lacks `getOrCreateModuleJob`/`getModuleJobForImport`)
- `dsh-settings` lacks the old `installSettingsSection`/`settingsNamespace` exports (restore them and delegate to `SettingsProvider.installSection` for community plugins on the old API)
- The bare address `127.0.0.1:3080` in a browser/favorite always shows 401 "authentication required" (dsh-client-connection loopback is exempt from the token and auto-mints a 30-day cookie; stale token URLs are also re-minted)

## Performance Benchmarks: "Hexagon" scores of the five presets (2026-08-18)

Benchmark engine = **Hexagon capability radar** (6 axes × 2 questions each = 12 auto-graded questions across math/code/logic/facts/planning/self-correction, via the opencode-go API with free cost:0) + **performance table** (DeepSeek direct API, same prefix sent 4 times in a row, measuring the 4th send's steady-state cache hit rate; prefix cache billed in 128-token chunks) + **delivery quality table** (3 process questions scored by marking hits against delivery steps, measuring how thoroughly the persona's delivery discipline is followed).

### Hexagon capability radar

| Preset | Math | Code | Logic | Facts | Planning | Self-correction | Overall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `harmony-chat` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | **100** |
| `harmony-chat-pro` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | **100** |
| `harmony-chat-promax` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | **100** |
| `harmony-chat-ops` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | **100** |
| `harmony-chat-rampagemax` | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | 100 | **100** |

The capability floor is identical and perfect—all five presets share the same model, so the benchmark is really comparing **performance and delivery discipline**, not capability.

### Performance table (before → after: after padding the persona with static instructions to cross the 128-token chunk boundary)

| Preset | Prefix tokens | Cache hit rate | Output efficiency (median tok/correct question) | Avg. time |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `harmony-chat` | 273 | 52.9% → **93.8%** | 70 | 130s |
| `harmony-chat-pro` | 406 | 71.3% → **94.6%** | 73 | 98s |
| `harmony-chat-promax` | 794 | 87.2% → **96.7%** | 104 | **71s** |
| `harmony-chat-ops` | 523 | 97.9% → 97.9% | 155 | 99s |
| `harmony-chat-rampagemax` | 914 | 89.9% → **98.0%** | 125 | 142s |

### Delivery quality (delivery-spec adherence)

| Preset | Integration loop W1 | Verify before claiming done W2 | Retrospective & wrap-up W3 | Overall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `harmony-chat` | 75 | 75 | 67 | **72** |
| `harmony-chat-pro` | 25 | 50 | 67 | **47** |
| `harmony-chat-promax` | **100** | **100** | 67 | **89** |
| `harmony-chat-ops` | 25 | 50 | 33 | **36** |
| `harmony-chat-rampagemax` | **100** | 75 | **100** | **92** |

**Conclusions**

- **ProMax = the Hexagon all-rounder**: full marks across all six capability axes, performance maxed out—cache 96.7% in the top tier, output efficiency 104 tok (most economical among fully-featured presets), average time 71s the fastest of all, delivery-spec score 89 second only to Rampage Max. **Performance and delivery discipline in one.**
- **Rampage Max = the ceiling of delivery quality**: delivery-spec score **92, the highest of all**, integration loop 100 + retrospective & wrap-up 100 (the only full marks)—verification/retrospective/loop carried through most thoroughly; cache 98.0% also the highest, but efficiency 125 tok and time 142s the longest, as intended by the "no token savings, quality first" design.
- **Minimal harmony-chat is the most output-frugal**: efficiency 70 tok the lowest of all, but no delivery-discipline clauses, delivery 72; pro is the next most frugal at 73 tok, but delivery discipline is weak (47).
- **Cache optimization is immediately effective**: padding static persona instructions pushes the prefix across the 128-token chunk boundary (remainder ≤15), raising the hit rate from 52.9-89.9% to 93.8-98.0%—cached input is roughly **30×** cheaper than uncached, so prefix stability is the biggest lever.
- For runtime-context presets (harmony-chat / rampagemax), real-session prefixes vary with snapshots; this is the ideal static baseline, so actual hit rates are slightly lower.

Raw data `bench/result.json`, report `bench/result.md`; the benchmark script `bench/bench.mjs` is reproducible.

## Toolchain

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/dsh-web.sh` | Start/restart the dsh Web service (3080, idempotent liveness probe) |
| `scripts/dsh-update.mjs` | dsh update checks: `check` / `patch` / `install` / `rollback`; re-applies patches automatically after an upgrade |
| `scripts/dsh-manual-install.mjs` | Manual installer: recursively resolves the full dependency graph from registry metadata and installs tarballs directly (bypasses npm arborist resolution hang); `install()`/`rollback()` call it automatically, npm as fallback |
| `scripts/dsh-update-web.sh` | Settings and update page (3098, embedded HTML) |
| `scripts/dsh-hm-install.mjs` | One-click install of GitHub-source plugins (bypasses isogit interception) |

All scripts support overriding the node path via the `NODE_BIN` environment variable (HarmonyOS default `/data/service/hnp/node.org/node_v24.13.0/bin/node`).

## HarmonyOS adaptation details

### What the installer does (`dsh-hm-install.mjs`)

When you click a GitHub-source plugin in the market (intercepted via the `process.platform === 'openharmony'` branch):
1. `fetch` the source `tar.gz` and recursively scan for plugin directories carrying a dsh manifest
2. Install directly if precompiled artifacts exist; otherwise **attempt an in-place build** (`--ignore-scripts` as a fallback for native postinstall)
3. Strip the missing `dsh.client` frontend artifacts (prevents `MissingClientBundleError` from crashing startup), installing server-only
4. Symlink into the `~/.dsh/profiles/web` dependency tree, write the manifest, and take effect after a restart

> ⚠ **link plugins must live inside the `~/.dsh` tree**: put the source in `plugins-src/<name>` and write `link:/storage/Users/currentUser/.dsh/profiles/web/plugins-src/<name>` in `package.json`; otherwise the `@deepseek-ai/*` symlinks won't resolve.

### Which plugins can be installed

Only plugins depending on **pure JS / `node:sqlite`** are selected. Native dependencies (koffi/pty/esbuild/WASM runtimes) cannot run on HarmonyOS.

---

## Limitations

- No `systemd` / `cron` / `XDG autostart`; HarmonyOS has no autostart system service. For autostart, set the "Terminal" App to launch on boot in HarmonyOS settings plus a shell liveness hook to pull the service up
- `bash`/terminal execution and the sandbox are disabled; the Agent cannot actually run shell commands, and can only work through file editing / web search / Skills / planning / delegation
- Cannot switch back to the official `standard` / `code` / `minimal` presets (they depend on disabled native capabilities and will report `agent-preset-invalid`)
- Pure-UI client plugins become empty shells; WASM-runtime dependencies only crash when invoked

## Changelog

### 2026-09-09 — Fix "web UI cannot message sessions" after 0.1.3-alpha.2 (4 resume-chain regressions)

Resuming any pre-upgrade session failed mid-resume, so sending from the web UI appeared broken. Root causes, each fixed:

- **`patchSessionVerify()` scope bug (fatal)**: the inserted `verifyCurrentFile` callback referenced an out-of-scope `internals`, so every v0 resume threw `ReferenceError: internals is not defined`; it now delegates to the module-level `defaultGenerationRuntime.verify`.
- **Migration publish hard-link EPERM (fatal)**: v0→v2 on-demand publication used `fs.link()`, which HarmonyOS `/storage` rejects with EPERM even for absent targets; new idempotent `patchMigrationPublish()` falls back to `rename` after confirming the target is absent (same pattern as the existing `dsh-fs-local` workaround).
- **`dsh-pet` 0.2.6 cold-boot crash**: host entry imports `@electron/get`/`@electron-internal/extract-zip` native bindings at top level (dlopen fails on HarmonyOS, no musl prebuild), crashing plugin-tree load into a watchdog restart loop; `harmony.patch.yml` now disables the `pet` row (0.2.0 loaded fine; re-enable once upstream is pure JS).
- **agent-presets persona key migration**: `dsh-persona` in 0.1.3-alpha.2 requires `prefix` instead of the old `text` key; all presets (harmony-chat/deveco/liangshen etc.) were migrated to `prefix`.


### 2026-09-09 — Client glass theme / on-device local AI + Huawei plugins shipped in-repo

- **`plugins/dsh-huawei-devdocs` and `plugins/dsh-huawei-local-llm` are now shipped in-repo**, byte-identical to the running `plugins-src` copies (incl. the `(_args, value)` render-signature fix, guard messages without `form:"guard"`, MIT LICENSE and test fixtures). `dsh-hm-update.mjs` auto-deploys every profile-level plugin under `plugins/`, so no separate install step is needed.
- **The HarmonyOS client now declares `ohos.permission.USE_AI`** (system_basic) with a permission-reason string; the signing / whitelist paths are documented in `docs/LOCAL-AI-USE_AI.md`.
- **Client UI "immersive glass" pass**: glass layers, light borders and a brand gradient were added to the theme tokens; the settings panel moved to a `bindSheet` half-modal (MEDIUM/LARGE detents + blur + drag bar), and the sidebar / chat / input / message views were glassified.

### 2026-09-09 — Follow official 0.1.3-alpha.2 (legacy-session migration compat + loader frame-split compression)

dsh upgraded to official `0.1.3-alpha.2` (released 2026-09-08; local dsh-test upgraded). The official release freezes released-v0 sessions to read-only validation and adds v0→v2 generation migration; the frozen checks are too strict for dev-era logs, so every session history failed to load after the upgrade ("model cannot load"):

- **worker.cjs migration verification moved back to the main thread (`patchSessionVerify()`) + CJS zstd twin `compat-loader-cjs.cjs`**: the official migration verifier defaults to worker_threads; the worker pulls ESM packages via CJS `require`, which node v22.7.0 cannot do. It now verifies on the main thread (`verifyCurrentGeneration`, same module, fzstd sync decode available) at the cost of losing thread isolation.
- **v0→v1 frozen-validation compat patch (new idempotent `patchSessionFormat()` in `patchAll`)**: only two legacy data shapes are admitted — plugin `source.form:"guard"` (guard messages from prompt-antivirus / huawei-devdocs; not a released-v0 form) and `subagent/descriptor` version 2 (deepseek-harness dev-era sessions). Everything else keeps the upstream closed whitelist. Full probe over all 251 v0 sessions through the official format catalog: 107 refused before → 0 failures after.
- **compat-loader frame-split compression**: the WASM zstd codec OOMs on single frames over ~4-8MB; migration publishing compresses an entire log at once, so 20MB+ sessions always aborted. `createZstdCompress` now compresses in 2MB frames and concatenates them; readers decode frames independently, so output semantics equal a single frame.
- **`harmony.patch.yml` disables `open-in-app` + `ui-open-in-app`**: the web-app bundle gained an open-in-app (host) plugin depending on native spawn (`dsh-subprocess`/`dsh-native-command`, unavailable on HarmonyOS) → the host stayed pending → the whole plugin tree failed to load.
- **Plugins stop writing non-standard `source.form`**: prompt-antivirus / huawei-devdocs guard messages drop `form:"guard"` (source keeps only `kind` + `plugin`) so new sessions no longer persist custom forms the released validator rejects.

Verified: after restart, 3080 is healthy with no OOM; all 251 sessions migrate to v2 through the official chain.

### 2026-09-03 — Follow official 0.1.2-rc.1 (all 9 patch anchors hit + 2 self-updater compat fixes)

dsh upgraded to official `0.1.2-rc.1` (released 2026-09-03); the local dsh-test is synced and the web UI verified to start. All nine node_modules patch anchors matched rc.1, and after re-applying, 3080 behaves normally:

- **`ensureCompatDeps()` drops npm for direct tarball install**: the rc.1 closure no longer contains `fzstd`/`zstd-codec` (compat-loader deps). The old `npm install` path made npm's arborist re-resolve the whole tree against the stale `^0.1.1-rc.2` range in `~/dsh-test/package.json`, **downgrading freshly-installed `0.1.2-rc.1` back to `0.1.1-rc.2`** and wiping every patch (reproduced this run). It now installs those two packages directly from the registry (manifest + tarball + tar), with zero side effects; new `syncPackageJson()` pins the installed dsh version into `~/dsh-test/package.json` after upgrade/rollback so no later `npm` run can downgrade again.
- **`dsh-web.sh` upgraded to a working HarmonyOS version + orphan-lock cleanup**: the in-repo `scripts/dsh-web.sh` was still the v24-node draft (crashes `ENOMEM` in the V8 code-range on HarmonyOS) and lacked compat-loader / the local market mirror / correct patch resolution. It now mirrors the machine-proven logic: default deveco node v22 + `--experimental-loader compat-loader.mjs` + `--patch harmony.patch.yml` + market mirror on 3988, with `NODE_BIN/DSH_DIR/PATCH_YML/PORT/LOG` env overrides. New `clear_stale_locks()` handles dsh's atomic-write orphan locks (SIGKILL/crash leaves `~/.dsh/profiles/node_modules.lock`, so the next boot dies with "timed out waiting for the writer lock" — reproduced this run); it clears them once before starting.
- Validation: `@deepseek-ai/dsh` 0.1.2-rc.1 (549-package closure); `node scripts/dsh-update.mjs patch` all-green (credential/session/permission/attachment/cordisLoader/settingsCompat/loopbackAuth/fsLocal re-applied, vision idempotent); 3080 returns 303 with a token; codex-bridge / deveco-bridge / cron / peak-valley / evoresearch / cost-meter all load. `bridge-browser` stays disabled (rc.1 `dsh-api-remotes` still doesn't restore `ApiRemoteSessionNotFound`).

### 2026-09-01 — Follow official 0.1.2-alpha.3 (fs-local patch + self-updater fix)

dsh upgraded to official `0.1.2-alpha.3` (released 2026-08-31); the local dsh-test is synced and the web UI verified to start:

- **`dsh-fs-local` patch folded into `patchAll` (new `patchFsLocal()`)** — new-file workspace writes (`createIfAbsent`) hit `EPERM` from `link()` on HarmonyOS `/storage`, even when the target is absent. This patch was previously missing from the self-updater, so every upgrade/reinstall wiped it and required a manual re-apply. It now follows the same "content-anchor + idempotency marker" pattern as the other patches and is re-applied automatically. Neither official `dsh-fs-local@0.1.2-alpha.3` nor alpha.2 (byte-identical) ships this fallback — confirmed by diffing the published tarballs.
- **Fixed the false-negative in `dsh-update.mjs` `isUp()`** — under token auth the bare `/` returns a 303 redirect when no cookie is present; `fetch()` follows redirects but does not carry the cookie across hops, so it lands on a 3xx again and was misread as "not up", making `install` fail even though the upgrade succeeded and the server was serving. Switched to `redirect:'manual'` and treat 2xx–3xx as up; `dsh-web.sh`'s `is_up` (curl waits on any response) remains the backstop.
- Validation: after `install`, `@deepseek-ai/dsh` reports `0.1.2-alpha.3` with `fsLocal=重打` and the other patches idempotent; `node scripts/dsh-update.mjs patch` is all-green; `/` on 3080 reaches 200 with a cookie, and `codex-bridge` / `deveco-bridge` / `cron` / `peak-valley` / `cost-meter` / `evoresearch` all load.

### 2026-08-31 — New preset harmony-chat-monash (Monash student edition)

Eighth "HarmonyOS conversation mode" preset (order 8), built on the `harmony-chat-promax` skeleton (`includeRuntimeContext: false` — fully static system prompt, high DeepSeek prefix-cache hit rate; identical tool set to ProMax: fs / web search / delegation / planning / workflows, pure JS with no native dependencies), with the persona specialized for Monash University students:

- **Literature interpretation**: one-sentence summary + research question → background → methods → results → discussion → limitations → relevance to the assignment; explains key terms and statistical methods (t-tests, regression, effect sizes) and provides ready-to-use citations (APA 7th by default, AGLC4 for legal sources)
- **Plagiarism check & academic integrity**: does not replace Turnitin — guides uploading drafts to Moodle for the Similarity Report, distinguishes legitimate citations from text needing rewriting with concrete rewriting strategies; red lines: contract cheating, buying essays, undeclared AI use, and self-plagiarism all violate the Student Academic Integrity Procedure
- **Assignment help**: breaks down task verbs + rubric → argument structure → key points → section-by-section draft review; never writes whole essays or fabricates references
- **Built-in knowledge base**: student services & libraries across Clayton / Caulfield / Docklands (Monash College), university-wide services (Student Academic Success / English Connect / counselling 03 9905 3020 / Safer Community / eSolutions / Career Connect; moodle.monash.edu · my.monash.edu · WES); Melbourne transport (free Intercampus Shuttle, Huntingdale / Caulfield / Southern Cross travel guides, myki concession / ISTP / Monash Commuter Club discounts; timetables per PTV Journey Planner)

### 2026-08-31 — Global prompt-antivirus dsh-prompt-antivirus (context-virus defense)

Ported the principle of `openclaw-prompt-antivirus` (runtime defense against prompt injection / mind-virus attacks) onto dsh as a profile-layer global plugin:

- **Four hook layers**: `tools/pre-execute` scans tool arguments (deny on high risk, human approval for dangerous tools), `tools/post-execute` scans tool results (where indirect injection hides; block/quarantine), `agent/pre-step` scans messages before they enter the model (`[CRON TASK]` / `[SCHEDULE REMINDER]` / web-search / file-content payloads are quarantined before reaching the model) plus a one-time per-session canary guard, and `llm/stream` sanitizes outbound text and detects canary hits (interrupts output in block mode).
- **Three modes**: `quarantine` (default; rewrites matched spans where in-place replacement is possible) / `block` (stricter + canary interrupt) / `monitor` (audit-only).
- **Tools & audit**: `_antivirus_scan` / `_antivirus_status` available per session; audit written to `~/.dsh/task-board/prompt-antivirus-audit.jsonl` (500-entry ring + 2 MB file cap, fail-silent).
- **Install**: shipped as `plugins/dsh-prompt-antivirus/`; `scripts/dsh-prompt-antivirus-install.mjs` installs it into the web + headless profiles idempotently (source → plugins-src + symlinks + manifest registration); `dsh-hm-update.mjs` auto-deploys all profile-level plugins under `plugins/`.
- **Validation**: 32 unit + harness tests green (signature coverage/severity, no false positives on benign Chinese text, three-mode decisions, one-time canary injection per session, canary interrupt/removal in the stream).

### 2026-08-30 — Built-in cron scheduled tasks for harmony-chat-ops

**The `harmony-chat-ops` resident background task steward gains full cron scheduling**:

- **Standard cron syntax**: new `cron_create` (standard 5-field cron "min hour day month weekday", with `@daily/@weekly/@monthly/@hourly` shortcuts and `JAN..DEC`/`SUN..SAT` names; when both day and weekday are restricted, either match triggers) + `cron_next` (validate the expression against the user's intent before creating) + management tools `cron_list` / `cron_set_enabled` / `cron_delete`; timezone defaults to `Asia/Shanghai`, overridable via `time_zone`.
- **`[CRON TASK]` framing semantics**: due tasks are delivered as untrusted task text (not new instructions); the agent executes and archives to `~/dsh-kb/` when idle. Tasks bind to the creating session—triggered on time while online, marked `overdue` offline, and only the latest missed run is backfilled on resume (no replay of backlog).
- **Backward compatible**: the old `schedule_create / schedule_list / schedule_delete` (after/at/every) remain available.

### 2026-08-22 — Fixed image reading and vision recognition (attachment-local + dsh-visual-plugin patches)

On this device, dragging an image into DeepSeek Harness then having the model see and describe it used to break at two levels: the image couldn't persist, and the vision endpoint wasn't configured.

- **`[Patch] dsh-attachment-local`**: HarmonyOS storage rejects `link()` with `EPERM` (Android/HarmonyOS don't support hard links), so publishing an image attachment into the same directory failed → read_image logged `Unable to persist image attachment`. The patch publishes via `copyFile(..., COPYFILE_EXCL)` when `link` fails (the `EEXIST` race still goes through the sha256 integrity check); `syncDirectory` skips that fsync on mount points that refuse a read-only handle (EPERM/EACCES/ENOTSUP). Fixes "read_image can read and persist".
- **`[Patch] dsh-visual-plugin`**: (1) When the vision panel is unconfigured, `resolvedFacts()` falls back to the main DeepSeek vision model — reusing the `llm-deepseek` (provider) section's `baseURL` + `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` with `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp`, eliminating "`vision model is not configured`"; (2) `describeImage` retries once when the model returns empty `content` (PROTOCOL) for a custom prompt, and if still empty degrades to a clear "model returned no content" message instead of hard-throwing. Fixes "a targeted prompt also returns a stable vision description".
- **Companion**: `settings.yaml` adds a `vision-bridge` section after `llm-deepseek` (url=DeepSeek, model=deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp, apiKeyEnv=DEEPSEEK_API_KEY) — double insurance with the code fallback and hot-reloadable.
- **`scripts/dsh-update.mjs`**: adds `patchAttachment()` / `patchVision()` (idempotent, content-anchored, marked `HarmonyOS patch`), merged into `patchAll()`'s five-way verification — re-applied automatically after upgrade/reinstall, so image reading no longer fails and vision no longer reports unconfigured.

### 2026-08-20 — Added the HarmonyOS Dev Master preset (harmony-deveco) + dev_code delegation to DevEco Code

**The 7th conversation mode `harmony-deveco`** (order 7, preset count six→seven), turning dsh into a HarmonyOS DevEco full-stack development agent:

- **dev_* toolchain**: drives hvigor/ohpm/hdc directly through dsh-deveco-bridge (pure JS via node:child_process, no native deps), closing the "write ArkTS → build → deploy to device → launch" loop, including release signing/packaging guidance
- **`dev_code` delegation to the local DevEco Code agent**: deveco-bridge gained a 6th tool `dev_code` — hands a self-contained deep sub-task over HTTP to the local DevEco Code (OpenCode web, 127.0.0.1:4096), which runs its own agent loop; one at a time (`isConcurrencySafe:false`), model defaults to `deepseek-v4-pro`; `task` must be self-contained (the sub-agent has no memory of this session); returns cost/tokens metadata for post-mortems
- **Kirin X90 software-hardware-coordinated power discipline**: this device is 4-core AArch64 + 32GB; parallel multi-agent is the most power-hungry behavior — at most one delegating agent (subagent / dev_code) running at any time, tools step forward serially on their dependencies, concentrating "depth" on the few steps that truly need it (dev_code / pro sub-agents) — fast without burning the cores
- **Verified loop**: after restarting dsh, `deveco-bridge` registers 6 tools (including dev_code); end-to-end dev_code delegation measured 4.2s / 13,528 tokens / ¥0.0002 returning a correct answer; repo preset matches `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/harmony-deveco/`

### 2026-08-20 — Follow official 0.1.0-rc.8

dsh was officially updated to `0.1.0-rc.8` (released 2026-08-19); this repository's ported version is synced. Upgrade highlights:

- **`dsh-update.mjs getLatest()` dist-tags fix**: the official `dist-tags.latest` stayed at rc.7 after rc.8 shipped, so `npm view version` reported "already latest". It now scans the full `versions` list and picks the numerically highest (rc.N and stable compared by number); `check` verified `installed = latest = 0.1.0-rc.8`.
- **New `scripts/dsh-manual-install.mjs`**: npm's arborist silently hangs during dependency resolution on HarmonyOS (no output, low CPU, times out — reproduced 3×). The manual installer recursively resolves the full dependency graph from registry metadata and installs tarballs directly, keeping baseline packages that already satisfy their spec and gating optional dependencies by `os`/`cpu`. Verified a 470-package closure with zero gaps. Wired into `dsh-update.mjs` `install()`/`rollback()` with npm as fallback.
- **rc.8 dependency tree**: 54 `@deepseek-ai/dsh-*` packages bumped `^0.1.0-rc.7` → `^0.1.0-rc.8` (including official changes: pass reasoning_content back on every reasoned turn, SQLite persistence layout optimization, Agent Teams directory renames, build artifact slot binding, pwsh persistent pty) plus new `@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-pwsh-persistent`.
- **All three HarmonyOS patches anchored cleanly on rc.8**: credentials (skip chmod-600 owner check), session (link→rename + `rename` import; the SQLite change did not touch the JSONL persistence file), permission (`ctx.shell.sandboxMode` → `ctx.fs.sandboxMode`).
- **Verified loop**: manual install of rc.8 → re-apply patches → restart dsh → 3080 HTTP 200 → plugins load (deveco-bridge 5 tools / evoresearch / dsh-cost-meter) → all seven HarmonyOS presets report `broken: none` in `agentPreset.list`.

### 2026-08-18 — Follow official 0.1.0-rc.7

dsh was officially updated to `0.1.0-rc.7` (released in the DeepSeek group chat); this repository's ported version is synced. Upgrade highlights:

- **`--ignore-scripts` bypasses the koffi native build**: the rc.7 dependency tree bumps koffi to 3.1.5, whose install script needs CMake to compile native binaries—HarmonyOS has no compiler, so it fails outright. Testing confirms koffi's native part is only lazy-loaded via dsh-fs-local on the win32 path (never triggered on HarmonyOS), node-pty is unavailable on this machine anyway, sharp ships precompiled, and all `@deepseek-ai` packages are pure JS with no install scripts—so skipping scripts entirely during install is safe. This is now baked into `scripts/dsh-update.mjs`, so future upgrades won't hit this pitfall again.
- **DeepSeek adds a `low` reasoning tier**: the official adapter now supports `off/low/high/max` (default remains `high`); `medium` is invalid. The measured note in `docs/CACHE-OPTIMIZATION.md` has been synced.
- **Upgrade loop**: npm install → re-apply the HarmonyOS patches (credentials/session) → restart dsh → 3080 works → all five presets' `agent.cordis.yml` pass the rc.7 `entryListSchema` validation and load successfully.

### 2026-08-18 — Benchmark rewritten as "Hexagon radar + performance table + delivery quality table"

The benchmark expanded from 6 questions to 6 axes × 2 questions = 12 auto-graded questions, and a delivery quality table was added (3 process questions scored by marking hits against delivery steps). Key numbers: all five presets get full marks across the six capability axes (same-model capability floor); cache hit rate after static persona padding goes from 52.9-89.9% to 93.8-98.0%; delivery-spec scores—promax 89 (performance and discipline in one), rampagemax 92 the highest of all (only full marks in retrospective & wrap-up, but most expensive in efficiency/time). The script `bench/bench.mjs` is reproducible, with raw data `result.json` and report `result.md`. README summary synced: preset count four→five (added the `harmony-chat-rampagemax` row to the mode table), and the summary benchmark figures updated to the post-padding 93.8-98.0%.

### 2026-08-18 — Added the Rampage Max preset (no token savings, quality first)

**The fifth conversation mode `harmony-chat-rampagemax`**, the opposite of promax—trades cache for quality; use with caution (high token consumption):

- **Runtime context enabled** (`includeRuntimeContext:true`), prefix varies dynamically with the session, low cache hit rate
- **Web fetch fully enabled** (`fetch:true`, search timeout relaxed to 30s), can fetch full page text for verification
- **Double verification + cross-checking on critical paths**; light tasks get no shortcuts, everything runs the full loop
- **Exhaustive pre-check scan**: namespace / wiring.id / system-prompt slots / settings-page order / tool names checked one by one
- **Full-Pro delegation**: subagents are always routed to deepseek-v4-pro, getting it right the first time
- **Built-in caution warning in the persona**: "May drain the entire account quota in one go; use only for hard debugging, cross-file refactoring, or the final check before delivery"

**Measured loop**: YAML parsing passes → synced the running copy → dsh restarted → `agentPreset.list` shows "HarmonyOS Rampage Max loaded, broken: none" → `agentPreset.read` returns the full 7409-character text including the caution warning / quality-first / double / exhaustive / delegation.

### 2026-08-18 — Hexagon ProMax: delivery discipline upgrade

**promax's persona block was rewritten into six hard rules** (task tiering / pre-check / implementation / integration loop / verify before claiming done / delegation), all static text, no dynamic content injected, cache hit rate unaffected. The core is writing "integration loop" and "verify before claiming done" as an unskippable mechanical checklist: delivery = files written + node_modules symlinks + restart + boot verification + live test.

**Trigger**: the measured test of using promax to write the Arknights operator character plugin (dsh-arknights-persona). Result—code delivery 9/10 (zero syntax errors, all APIs correct, idiomatic framework), but the integration loop was only 6/10 (symlink not created, no restart, no boot verification, no live test). Conclusion: **the gap is in finishing discipline, not intelligence**, so each shortfall became a rule in the persona. See "2.4 Hexagon ProMax" above.

### 2026-08-17 — Added the ops resident task steward mode + scheduled tasks

**New features**

- **The `harmony-chat-ops` resident background task steward preset**: an unattended task mode for HarmonyOS devices, pure JS with zero native dependencies. Three categories of duties—knowledge organization (read directory → extract → deduplicate → archive to `~/dsh-kb/`), batch file processing (rename/archive/deduplicate → manifest to `~/dsh-kb/logs/`), and scheduled tasks (standard cron expressions via `cron_create` + `schedule_create` every/at, executed and archived when idle). Things outside these three categories are first confirmed with the user.
- **`@deepseek-ai/dsh-tool-list` directory enumeration plugin**: dsh's fs service has no readdir, so the ops mode cannot discover directory contents. This adds a zero-dependency `list_dir` tool (`node:fs/promises`) supporting relative paths, file sizes, and a 200-entry limit.
- **`harmony.patch.yml` mounts dsh-schedule for scheduled tasks**: registers `schedule_create / schedule_list / schedule_delete` for the web session's root agent (the package ships with dsh's base installation); one-shot/periodic reminders auto-trigger when due, and the agent executes and archives them when idle.
- **Delegated subagents route to Pro**: overrides `tool-subagent`'s `agentOptions` entirely by id to `deepseek-v4-pro` (measured: agentOptions inside presets don't take effect; the profile-layer override is required). The flash main loop saves cost; complex subtasks go to Pro to be done right the first time, avoiding repeated trial-and-error round trips.

**Measured loop (verified on this machine)**

- Manual batch: an ops session enumerated 3 meeting notes in `~/dsh-kb-test/notes/` → read → deduplicated "budget ok" → archived to `~/dsh-kb/会议纪要/*.md` (with a source table).
- Scheduled: `schedule_create after_seconds: 60` auto-triggers when due, and the agent independently produces `~/dsh-kb/reports/notes-summary-*.md`; after a one-shot reminder executes, it no longer appears in `schedule_list`.
- Regression: the existing harmony-chat / pro / promax presets all load without errors and web stays UP; test data has been cleaned up.

**Fixes**

- Fixed the bug where creating new sessions failed: custom plugin package names referenced by presets must exist in both dsh's base `node_modules` and the profile-layer `node_modules` symlink layer (the host composition base resolves upward to `profiles/node_modules`); a missing symlink causes preset mount failure → `SessionCreateError`. Install steps are in "2.5" above. `dsh-tool-list` has been put in place on this dual path.
